/**
 * Here some functions about printing on the logger are defined
 * 
 * If this header has been included after have defined USE_LOGGER_JPL macro, the logger of the jpl framework will be used.
 * 
 * If you have already included this header with the definition of the macro which had been talked about above, but now you need to print with cout
 * always in the same program, you just need to undefine that macro before include it. Just remember to re-define it after you have included 
 * this header or whenever it is needed again.
 * 
 * Type of message is defined into Logger.hpp, but they're used by cout, too. 
 * If the first time you have included this header, you have not used the USE_LOGGER_JPL macro, an internal definion of LOG_STATUs are done.
 * Do not take care about re-definition of them if you have included later it with the macro defined, ODR is done
