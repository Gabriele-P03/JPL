~\newline
 This module provides you several useful function which are used through all JPL\textquotesingle{}s module. It is splitted into headers file which can be considered as sub-\/modules ~\newline
~\newline
 This module may be seen even as a SDM (Self-\/\+Dependency Module) since some of its headers include some others of this same module. ~\newline
~\newline
 Since all its headers can be considered as sub-\/modules, you can download those ones you need and discard all other ones (unless they are not included by those ones you need). ~\newline

Debug\+Utils \begin{quote}
To provides some function whilst debugger is attached or about stacktrace and errors occurred~\newline
 In order to get a more readable stacktrace, everytime that either a shared or static object is made up by yourself, you should always build them with debug symbols$<$br$>$~\newline
 e.\+g.~\newline
 g++ -\/g \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}--debug symbol -\/f\+PIC -\/c -\/o test.\+out test.\+cpp~\newline
 g++ -\/shared -\/o libtest.\+so test.\+out~\newline
 \doxysubsection*{For windows machine only\+:}

\doxysubparagraph*{In order to print a more detailed stacktrace, you should extract .pdb (which contains symbols, also used by gdb) file from the compiled exe. I use \href{https://github.com/rainers/cv2pdb}{\texttt{ cv2pdb}} which generate a file named as the executable one. Put it in mind that, once invoked cv2pdb (via CLI is \char`\"{}cv2pdb64.\+exe your\+\_\+executable\+\_\+file.\+exe\char`\"{}), all symbols are removed from the .exe and then, if you invoke gdb on it, it will not encounter any breakpoints.}
