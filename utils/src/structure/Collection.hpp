 * An knowledgment of DSA theory is required, since these documentation are not intendeed to teach it...
 * 
 * Since JPL provides Exception module, and this one Function Interfaces, and, as an elephant in the room, 
 * they cannot be used with std data-structures already provided, this sub-module offers several data-structure 
 * compatible with them
 * 
 * They follow the DSA hierarchy, but there are some them which could not be assimilated right as it (e.g. ArrayList)
 * 
 * This is the more abstract class which is extended by all JPL's data-structures. Some of its children could permit null-elements
 * insertion, or even duplicate one. Read their documentation to get more info.
