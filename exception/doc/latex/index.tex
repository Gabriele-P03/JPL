\doxysubsection*{{\itshape Exception}}

~\newline
 This module provides you some exception which could be useful in order to give more information about errors encourented during the life of your program. ~\newline
All exception are extended as an hierarchy which as you can read in this documentation ~\newline
~\newline
 Keep in mind that, although JPL provide \href{https://github.com/Gabriele-P03/Libraries/tree/main/logger}{\texttt{ Logger}}, it is not used in this module to print messages of occurred exception, it will be your duty to do it.~\newline
 Otherwise, you have to define USE\+\_\+\+EXCEPTION\+\_\+\+W\+\_\+\+LOGGER\+\_\+\+JPL before to include \href{https://github.com/Gabriele-P03/JPL/blob/main/logger/src/LoggerWrapper.hpp}{\texttt{ Logger\+Wrapper.\+hpp}} ~\newline
~\newline
 The message of the thrown exception can be retrieved via what() function.~\newline
 Some of those override this function in order to take out a template message composed by different arguments.~\newline
 Check each of them to get more information. ~\newline
~\newline
 This module can be involved into using JPL\textquotesingle{}s Stacktrace feature -\/ provided by \href{https://github.com/Gabriele-P03/Libraries/tree/main/utils}{\texttt{ Utils}} (into debug) -\/ defining USE\+\_\+\+STACKTRACE\+\_\+\+W\+\_\+\+EXCEPTION\+\_\+\+JPL, then you will be able to get stacktrace of the thrown exception via get\+Stacktrace(). ~\newline
 Also, defining that macro, the stacktrace will be printed when the exception instance is passed to std\+::cout ~\newline
