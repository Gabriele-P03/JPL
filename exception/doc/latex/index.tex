~\newline
 This module provides you some exception which could be useful in order to give more information about errors encourented during the life of your program. ~\newline
All exception extends the same parent class, i.\+e. Abstract\+Exception, although there is a defined hierarchy -\/ packaging -\/ as you can see below. ~\newline
 ~\newline
~\newline
 Keep in mind that, although JPL provide \href{https://github.com/Gabriele-P03/Libraries/tree/main/logger}{\texttt{ Logger}}, it is not used in this module to print messages of occurred exception, it will be your duty to perform it. ~\newline
~\newline
 The message of thrown exception can be retrieved via what() function. Some of these exception override it in order to take out a template message composed by different argumentd passed to constructors.
