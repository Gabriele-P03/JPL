/**
 * A NoSuchMethodException is thrown whenever a method which had been attempted to be get via reflexpr TS
 * or any other kind of reflection feature that will be implemented later in C++, has not been found.
 * 
 * Since reflexpr TS is experimental this exception could seem as useless, indeed it is though for a later feature.
 * 
 * As explained in AbstractException's documentation, altough constructors are declared as public, you should avoid to call them.
 * It can be thrown by constructor with 2 parameters (as you can see by the macro defined at the end of this file)
 *
 * In this exception what() is overriden in order to print the Method which is illegal.
