 This module offers to JPL project a Logger which is able to print onto terminal and write into a log file.

As you can see if you take a look at the header file, there\textquotesingle{}s a static instance which is used by JPL\textquotesingle{}s modules that need to tell occurred events.~\newline
 This instance is always initialized unless you define CUSTOM\+\_\+\+LOGGER\+\_\+\+JPL macro which prevent the automatic definition of it and delegate to you the duty of defining it.

You should never avoid any definition of that, since no modules check a Null\+Pointer on that static-\/member before to have called print() and therefore a Exception will be thrown (not JPL\textquotesingle{}s one).~\newline


In other words, for your project\textquotesingle{}s function you can use either an another instance of Logger or the static one; but you cannot leave JPL\textquotesingle{}s module without a logger instance.~\newline

\doxysubsection*{{\itshape QUIET MODE}}

The quiet mode do not allow to logger to write on file (it will only print on terminal). It can be achieved with the true boolean flag passed to constructor.~\newline
This mode is available for the static instance used by JPL\textquotesingle{}s modules even without defining CUSTOM\+\_\+\+LOGGER\+\_\+\+JPL and then call a constructor. You just need to define QUIET\+\_\+\+MODULES\+\_\+\+LOGGER\+\_\+\+JPL macro \end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\doxysubsection*{{\itshape UNFORCED WRITING}}

The unforced writing mode does allow to program to keep running although the output file could not be created. Printing on terminal will be performed.~\newline
Define UFW\+\_\+\+LOGGER\+\_\+\+JPL macro to enable this feature \end{quote}
~\newline
 \doxysubsection*{{\bfseries{Please Note}}}

If UNFORCED WRITING\textquotesingle{}s macro has been defined and, either QUIET MODE\textquotesingle{}s macro is even defined or quiet parameter is set as true, they will not cause any errors.~\newline
 Of course, QUIET MODE has an higher priority rather than the other one ~\newline
~\newline
 This module needs to be compiled as shared one in order to be used, and then you have to include the library (.so/.dll) in compile-\/time and run-\/time.~\newline
 By the way, I have already provided you the CMake\+Lists.\+txt file; since this project has been developed under Ubuntu, the text file has uncommented istruction for linux kernel (windows\textquotesingle{} ones are commented).~\newline
 A toolchain file is provided, too, with windows compiler.
