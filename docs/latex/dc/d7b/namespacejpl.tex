\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The profiler is, as well-\/known, a tool which probes processors and memory consumption by the current process. This one do it even for global information (i.\+e. Total Mem, Total CPU).

You can use it once or as a scheduled thread. ~\newline
 For the first mode, you just have to call Profiler\# ~\newline


Usually we represents the CPU usage as a percentage of elapsed time since process started. So the total CPU usage of an application is the sum of utime and stime, divided by elapsed time

This is a wrapper header file which helps a collection either to print its elements or to generate a string which represents its elements. Generally you can pass a collection to the std\+::cout. If T is a pointer, addresses will be printed, else the operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} will be used; therefore you oughta decleare that type of function, otherwise a compilation-\/error will occur ~\newline
