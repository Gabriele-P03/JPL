/**
 * A MainServerSocket is an extention of MainSocket specialized as Server.
 * 
 * MainSocket constructor, for the server one, takes care only about setting and binding socket.
 * The listen and accept parts are done by this extended class  
 * 
 * Once you have created a new object of this class, the first function that you should call is setMaxQueue() in order to make the call to listen(),
 * the parameter given to setMaxQueue() is the max number of request connection that can stay in queue.
 * This function, even if it can call at all time, will modify the value of max_queue filed only one time; then you will have to take care to delete
 * and create a new one instance of it...
 * 
 * Then, you should set the flagLoop, used by the accept loop as flag, via setLoopFlag(). A true value given, is not enough to start the accept loop 
 * as a separated thread. For that, you must call startLoopAcceptThread().
 * If you wanna stop the thread, but waiting a last request connection, you can call setLoopFlag() with a false parameter; when the last request is done, 
 * the function will end up and the thread will be over (read next paragraph).
 * In order to start again it, you must set the loopFlag as true via setLoopFlag().
 * 
 * A setter has been done for clientListController to let you instance an extended class, too. Check setClientListController()
