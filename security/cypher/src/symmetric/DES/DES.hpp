/**
 * This implementation of DES provides CBC and ECB mode which can be used calling relative encryption/decryption function.
 * 
 * Do not pass either IV or key as hexdecimal, since the convertion in binary is done by the function and then
 * all ASCII chars can be used with this framework.
 * 
 * A nullptr is returned by those function whenever an error is previously occurred or during the called one.
 * You can check the last error calling jpl::_security::_cypher::checkError().
 * 
 * Due to what has been said above, you must call set_CBC_IV() before any call to CBC mode or a nullptr will be returned.
 * 
 * The conversion from chars to binary digits has been structured using boolean array as long as eight times the const char array.
 * This conversion is performed by the external "ConversionUtils.hpp" jpl-utils header file.
 * 
 * The XOR is performed by the external "BitsUtils.hpp" jpl-utils header file.
 * 
 * All the matrices used by DES algorithm are declared inside an external header file and then defined in a source file
