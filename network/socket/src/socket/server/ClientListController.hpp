/**
 * It provides an std::vector of pointers to Client (those ones created by accept() of MainServerSocket).
 * 
 * Here you are some functions which take care about adding, removing and checking these instances of Clients.
 * 
 * If you wanna that new client has to be checked if it has permissions to join server, you should call loadPermission giving ifstream of the file where 
 * they will be read from. If you're not interested to extend this class, be aware that this one read only from CSV file as follow:
 *      name_client,ip,root
 * 
 * If loadPermission() has not been called, every client will be able to join to the server (but with no root permission).
 * 
 * This class offers a poor quality of security, it is unreliable; then it is recommended to extends this class and implement your more fitting 
 * security system.
 * 
 * The structure of permission of this class provides (as you have read above) name_client,ip,root; then if you wanan implement your own security system,
 * apart to override loadPermission(), you should do isClientAllowed(), too; but, even if you do not need to override addNewClient(), you should at least 
 * copy-paste the parent function body, in order to make it call the overriden functions.
